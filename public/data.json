It marks a deliberate attempt by the band to move away from the introspective guitar-oriented sound of their previous album The Bends. Its layered sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time and laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work."

The album's original cover depicted the band members' upper bodies without clothing. This caused critics to accuse the band of trying to sell themselves as \"poster boys for the master race\". The cover was replaced with a less controversial design for the album's international release. Despite the controversy, Herzeleid has been well received by critics and has since been certified platinum in Germany."
